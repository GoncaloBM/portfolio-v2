        Mechanical engineer by training but my passion has always been computer
        science. I'm a very hard working person with an atention to the detail
        extremely high with focus on good quality. With my professional
        experience I have been able to be very stress resistant and always been
        pushed to deliver projects on time, and as well as with my project
        management experience, you can count with a human-bot in terms of
        organizing and task scheduling. I always like to learn the lastest
        technologies to improve myself, and to help others around to improve as
        well. Share with me your ideas, and get ready to have your project come
        alive.
